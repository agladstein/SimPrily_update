# SimPrily_update

Created by Ariella Gladstein, based on [SimPrily](https://agladstein.github.io/SimPrily/index.html).  

## About
SimPrily runs genome simulations with user defined parameters or parameters randomly generated by priors and computes genomic statistics on the simulation output.  

1. Run genome simulation with model defined by prior distributions of parameters and demographic model structure.
2. Take into account SNP array ascertainment bias by creating pseudo array based on priors of number of samples of discovery populations and allele frequency cut-off.
3. Calculate genomic summary statistics on simulated genomes and pseudo arrays. 

This is ideal for use with Approximate Bayesian Computation on whole genome or SNP array data.

Uses c++ programs macs and GERMLINE. For more information on these programs, see:

## Install

cd to the directory you want to work in,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agladstein/SimPrily.git
```

#### Environment Set up
If using Vagrant (this is recommended if running on non-Linux OS):

Start Vagrant, ssh into Vagrant, cd to SimPrily directory:
```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
``` 
Install the virtual environment and install the requirements.
```bash
./setup/setup_env_vbox_2.7.sh
```

If not using Vagrant, just install the virtual environment and install the requirements:
```bash
./setup/setup_env_2.7.sh
```


## Usage

e.g. One Test simulation:  
```
python simprily.py -p examples/eg1/param_file_eg1_asc.txt -m examples/eg1/model_file_eg1_asc.csv -g genetic_map_b37/genetic_map_GRCh37_chr1.txt.macshs -a array_template/ill_650_test.bed -i 1 -o output_dir -v
```

For quick help:
```
python simprily.py --help
```

#### Input  
`simprily.py` takes 4 required arguments and 2 optional arguments, and help, verbose, and profile options.   

Run as  
```
python simprily.py [-h] -p PARAM -m MODEL -i ID -o OUT [-g MAP] [-a ARRAY] [-v] [--profile]
```
##### Required 
`-p PARAM` or `--param PARAM` = The location of the parameter file  
`-m MODEL` or `--model MODEL` = The location of the model file  
`-i ID` or `--id ID` = The unique identifier of the job  
`-o OUT` or `--out OUT` = The location of the output directory  
 
##### Optional
`-h` or `--help` = shows a help message and exists  
`-v` = increase output verbosity. This includes 3 levels, `-v`, `-vv`, and `-vvv`  
`--profile` = Print a log file containing the time in seconds and memory use in Mb for main functions  
`-g MAP` or `--map MAP` = The location of the genetic map file  
`-a ARRAY` or `--array ARRAY` = The location of the array template file, in bed form  

#### Output
Three subdirectories are created in the directory specified in the `output_dir` argument.  
```
output_dir/results
output_dir/sim_data
output_dir/germline_out
```

##### Intermediate files
Intermediate files go to `output_dir/sim_data` and `output_dir/germline_out`.    
`output_dir/sim_data` contains PLINK formated .ped and .map files created from the pseudo array, which are necessary to run GERMLINE.  
`output_dir/germline_out` contains the GERMLINE .match output and .log. The .match contains all of the identified IBD segments.  
These files are NOT automatically removed in python script, but are unnecessary once the job is complete.  

##### Results files
Output files go to `output_dir/results`.  
`output_dir/results` contains the parameter values used in the simulation and the summary statistics calculated from the simulation.  
The first line is a header with the parameter names and summary statistics names.
The second line is the parameter values and summary statistics values.  

-------------------------

## HPC Workflow

Use `checkque.sh` to submit jobs to Ocelote.

Arguments are `goal_number`, `max_que`, `chr`  

```bash
/home/u15/agladstein/SimPrily_update/update_test/checkque.sh 10000 500 1
```

-------------------------


## Known Issues
* If exponential growth is large, macs simulation will not finish. (This is a macs bug).
* If the same id is used with the same output dir as a previous run, the .map file will be appended to.
